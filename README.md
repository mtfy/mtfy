<p align="center">I&#x2019;m an 18-year-old self-taught programmer from Finland. My passion lies in full-stack web development, and lately, I have been focusing on extending my knowledge in modern frameworks such as Laravel, React, Vue.js, Next.js, and Node.js. My meticulous eye for detail allows me to solve problems creatively and efficiently.</p>

<p align="center">I&#x2019;m also well-versed in standard DevOps practices and CI/CD pipelines, ensuring efficient deployment and maintenance of web applications. These practices help me create robust, scalable, and maintainable web applications that meet industry standards while prioritizing information security to safeguard data and user privacy.</p>


<p align="center">I have been freelancing as a web developer in my free time, allowing me to work on several remarkable projects. Unfortunately, I cannot showcase all of them on my GitHub portfolio due to the confidential nature of these freelancing projects.</p>


<p align="center">I possess knowledge and skills beyond web development, including skillsets in low-level programming languages such as C/C++. Moreover, I have a solid grasp of the fundamentals of the fascinating field of reverse engineering.</p>

<p align="center">Information & cyber security, and pentesting has also been an area of interest for me for a couple of years.</p>

<p align="center">Even though I don&#x2019;t have an university degree, I have the vocational qualification in Information Information and Communications Technology, which I graduated recently.</p>
